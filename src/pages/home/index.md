## A Better Way to Clean Windows

The 'Pole system', a series of interconnected pipes that can reach three or more stories high, has been hailed as a great invention by many.

But we've seen the results of using it, and believe there's a better way.

We use a hybrid system that uses a long pole, but still employs the traditional cleaning method &mdash; squeegee and mop &mdash; to make sure your windows are properly cleaned. This much more thorough method is used by professional cleaning companies across the country, and can be much more effective than the pole system.
